%% ABC + PSO Path Planning Problem
% Here, system tries to find the most optimal path between starting point
% and destination point with aid of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm
% and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm combined. It is good strategy
% in robotics path finding. In each run new obstacles in new positions
% defines and a curved line tries to find the best path. Run multiple times
% to find the best result. 
% Hope this code help you :)
